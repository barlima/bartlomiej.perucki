          In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and expressing my
          creativity through drawing. Although my traveling plans are currently
          on hold, I continue to explore new cultures and stories by researching
          and building my family tree. These activities help me stay active,
          unwind, and stay connected with my roots.
